    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Old Fashioned is one of the most venerable of cocktails, predating not only the motorcar but the presidency of Abe Lincoln.</p>
        <p>All it takes is serving whiskey, sugar, bitters and, if you like, a cherry or orange garnish on the rocks.</p>
        <p>Properly made, it's strong but not too strong, sweet but not too sweet, and, most importantly, it's dead-simple and absolutely delicious.</p>
